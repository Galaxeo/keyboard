# Keyboard Study Project
For all details regarding this project, please refer to my detailed write-up!

## Short Summary
In the past, linear switches in mechanical keyboards have been marketed as a gaming switch. wheraas the tactile switch variants have been catered towards those who wanted a better typing experience. However, marketing nowadays, especially with prebuilt keyboards, focus heavily on delivering the product itself, instead marketing every type of switch as a "gaming switch". This primary goal of this study was to see if this statement remained true, that linear and tactile switches had been viewed as gaming and typing switches respetively. As the project was being planned, it was realized as a good opportunity to look for any other correlations, and along with matplotlib and seaborn, a good time to introduce data analysis and visualization to the keyboard industry.

This project primarily uses kernal density estimation in the form of a violin plot in order to make up for the small data sample. Results and analysis is purely theoretical and can be heavily skewed in one direction, however the results do support the perception of the two linear and tacile switch types.
